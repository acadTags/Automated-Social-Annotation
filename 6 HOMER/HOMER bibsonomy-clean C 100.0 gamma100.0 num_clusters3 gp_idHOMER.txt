doc: regularization approach to inductive genetic programming this paper presents an approach to regularization of inductive genetic programming tuned for learning polynomials . the objective is to achieve optimal evolutionary performance when searching multivariate polynomials represented as tree structures . we show how to improve the genetic programming of polynomials by balancing its statistical bias with its variance . bias reduction is achieved by employing a set of basis polynomials in the tree nodes for better agreement with the examples . since this often leads to overfitting , such tendencies are by decreasing the variance through regularization of the fitness function . we demonstrate that this balance facilitates the search as well as enables discovery of parsimonious , accurate , and predictive polynomials . the experimental results given show that this regularization approach outperforms traditional genetic programming on benchmark data mining and practical timeseries prediction tasks .

doc: weaving a web of trust to date , world wide web security has been publicly associated with debates over cryptographic technology , protocols , and public policy . this narrow focus can obscure the wider challenge of building trusted web applications . since the web aims to be an information space that reflects not just human knowledge but also human relationships , it will soon reflect the full complexity of trust relationships among people , computers , and organizations . within the computer security community , trust management has emerged as a new philosophy for protecting open , decentralized systems , in contrast to traditional tools for securing closed systems . trust management is an essential approach , because the web crosses many trust boundaries that computer security cannot even begin to handle . in this paper , we consider how this philosophy could be applied to the web . we introduce the fundamental principles , principals , and policies of trust management , as well as webspecific pragmatic issues . in so doing , we develop a taxonomy for how trust assertions can be specified , justified , and validated . we demonstrate the value of this framework by considering the trust questions faced by the designers of applications for secure document distribution , content filtering , electronic commerce , and systems . we conclude by sketching the limits to trust management , demonstrating how trust on the web will adapt to the trust rules of human communities and vice versa .

doc: a speech mashup framework for multimodal mobile services todays proliferation of web content and mobile phones with broadband data access , interacting with factor devices is still cumbersome . spoken interaction could overcome the input limitations of mobile devices , but running an automatic speech recognizer with the limited computational capabilities of a mobile device becomes an impossible challenge when large vocabularies for speech recognition must often be updated with dynamic content . one popular option is to move the speech processing resources into the network by concentrating the heavy computation load onto server farms . although successful services have exploited this approach , it is unclear how such a model can be generalized to a large range of mobile applications and how to scale it for large deployments . to address these challenges we introduce the att speech mashup architecture , a novel approach to speech services that leverages web services and cloud computing to make it easier to combine web content and speech processing . we show that this new compositional method is suitable for integrating automatic speech recognition and synthesis resources into real multimodal mobile services . the generality of this method allows researchers and speech practitioners to explore a countless variety of mobile multimodal services with a finer grain of control and richer multimedia interfaces . moreover , we demonstrate that the speech mashup is scalable and particularly optimized to minimize round in the mobile network , reducing latency for better user experience .

doc: meningococcal carriers in high school students and possible risk factors from august 2004 to january 2005 a cluster of 7 cases of serogroup b meningococcal disease occurred in the state of in the town of sangerhausen and the surrounding area . this led to an investigation of meningococcal carriage in high school students grades 9 to 13 . the students were also asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding possible risk factors for carriage . the goal of the study was the evaluation of a possibly persistently increased risk for further cases in the region . results of the study were to be used for a comprehensive and targeted education of the public . the percentage of students found n . meningitidis in the in sangerhausen 9 . 0 was not elevated compared to that found in the two control regions of , county of sangerhausen 8 . 2 and , county of 9 . 9 . the serogroup b fine type responsible for the cluster p1 . 72 , was found only in one student each in sangerhausen and . thus , there was no evidence of an increased risk for further cases at the time of the study at the end of january , 2005 . this may have been due to intensive contact tracing and provision of chemoprophylaxis in sangerhausen . visiting a or bar and smoking were identified as risk factors for meningococcal carriage . however , these factors were associated with carriage only in boys but not in girls . this may be explained by differences in physical interaction with others . efforts to prevent further cases during clusters of meningococcal disease should consider risk behaviour .

doc: understanding emergency medical dispatch in terms of distributed cognition a case study emergency medical dispatch emd is typically a team activity , requiring fluid coordination and communication between team members . such working situations have often been described in terms of distributed cognition dc , a framework for understanding team working . dc takes account of factors such as shared representations and artefacts to support reasoning about team working . although the language of dc has been developed over several years , little attention has been paid to developing a methodology or reusable representation which supports reasoning about an interactive system from a dc perspective . we present a case study in which we developed a method for constructing a dc account of team working in the domain of emd , focusing on the use of the method for describing an existing emd work system , identifying sources of weakness in that system , and reasoning about the likely consequences of redesign of the system . the resulting dc descriptions have yielded new insights into the design of emd work and of tools to support that work within a large emd centre .

doc: the syntactic web xquery is a query language designed to allow queries across the many kinds of information that are represented in xml . although topic maps and rdf can also be represented in xml , many have held that their many possible syntactic forms make them extremely difficult to query using an xml query language , and that they can only be queried using specialpurpose query languages with builtin knowledge of their semantics , including the ability to exploit rdf schema information . this talk shows that xquery can , in fact , be used to solve the kinds of queries for which rdf and topic map query languages were designed , though with a loss of type safety . the approach taken is to transform instances of rdf and topic maps to a syntactic representation that closely models their underlying logical models , and to use function libraries written in xquery to directly support operations specific to rdf or topic maps . schema level information is also incorporated in this , and is supported in the library , so queries can exploit type hierarchies and perform across predicates . information from other xml sources can also be queried together with inform from topic maps and rdf . for instance , a query on a topic maps that searches for plays mentioned in italian can also query the plays themselves represented in xml to determine which italian cities are mentioned in them . syntax is not the opposite of semantics , it is a medium for semantics .

doc: dust formation in milky galaxies we introduce a dust model for cosmological simulations implemented in the code arepo and present a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoomin simulations to study dust formation within galactic haloes . our model accounts for the stellar production of dust , accretion of gasphase metals onto existing grains , destruction of dust through local supernova activity , and dust driven by winds from starforming regions . we find that accurate stellar and active galactic nuclei feedback is needed to reproduce the observed relation and that dust growth largely dominates dust destruction . our simulations predict a dust content of the interstellar medium which is consistent with observed scaling relations at z 0 , including between dusttogas ratio and metallicity , dust mass and gas mass , dusttogas ratio and stellar mass , and mass ratio and gas fraction . we find that roughly twothirds of dust at z 0 originated from type ii supernovae , with the contribution from asymptotic giant branch stars below 20 per cent for z gtrsim 5 . while our suite of milky galaxies forms dust in good agreement with a number of key observables , it predicts a high ratio in the circumgalactic medium , which motivates a more realistic treatment of thermal of grains and dust cooling channels .

doc: an introduction to latent semantic analysis latent semantic analysis lsa is a theory and method for extracting and representing the meaning of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text landauer and dumais , 1997 . the underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other . the adequacy of reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways . for example , its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests it mimics human word sorting and category judgments it simulates and lexical priming data and , as reported in 3 following articles in this issue , it accurately estimates passage coherence , learnability of passages by individual students , and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay .

doc: coevolutionary free recent work on the foundational underpinnings of blackbox optimization has begun to uncover a rich mathematical structure . in particular , it is now known that an inner product between the optimization algorithm and the distribution of optimization problems likely to be encountered the distribution over likely performances in running that algorithm . one of this is the no free theorems , which state that any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems . this highlights the need for exploiting knowledge to achieve better than random performance . in this paper , we present a general framework covering most optimization scenarios . in addition to the optimization scenarios addressed in the results , this framework covers problems and evolution of multiple players . as a particular instance of the latter , it covers problems . in these problems , the set of players work together to produce a champion , who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game . in contrast to the traditional optimization case where the results hold , we show that in there are free in coevolution some algorithms have better performance than other algorithms , averaged across all possible problems . however , in the typical coevolutionary scenarios encountered in biology , where there is no champion , the theorems still hold .

doc: human intelligence in the process of semantic content creation despite significant progress over the last years the largescale adoption of semantic technologies is still to come . one of the reasons for this state of affairs is assumed to be the lack of useful semantic content , a prerequisite for almost every it system or application using semantics . through its very nature , this content can not be created fully automatically , but requires , to a certain degree , human contribution . the interest of internet users in semantics , and in particular in creating semantic content , is , however , low . this is understandable if we think of several characteristics exposed by many of the most prominent semantic technologies , and the applications thereof . one of these characteristics is the high barrier of entry imposed . interacting with semantic technologies today requires specific skills and expertise on subjects which are not part of the mainstream it knowledge portfolio . a second characteristic are the incentives that are largely missing in the design of most semantic applications . the benefits of using machineunderstandable content are in most applications fully decoupled from the effort of creating and maintaining this content . in other words , users do not have a motivation to contribute to the process . initiatives in the areas of the social semantic web acknowledged this problem , and identified mechanisms to motivate users to dedicate more of their time and resources to participate in the semantic content creation process . still , even if incentives are theoretically in place , available human labor is limited and must only be used for those tasks that are heavily dependent on human intervention , and cannot be reliably automated . in this article , we concentrate

doc: kcore bootstrap percolation on complex networks critical phenomena and nonlocal effects we develop the theory of the kcore bootstrap percolation on random networks with arbitrary degree distributions . we show that the kcore percolation is an unusual , hybrid phase transition with a jump emergence of the kcore as at a first order phase transition but also with a critical singularity as at a continuous transition . we describe the properties of the kcore , explain the meaning of the order parameter for the kcore percolation , and reveal the origin of the specific critical phenomena . we demonstrate that a socalled corona of the kcore plays a crucial role corona is a subset of vertices in the kcore which have exactly k neighbors in the kcore . it turns out that the kcore percolation threshold is at the same time the percolation threshold of finite corona clusters . the mean separation of vertices in corona clusters plays the role of the correlation length and diverges at the critical point . we show that a random removal of even one vertex from the kcore may result in the collapse of a vast region of the kcore around the removed vertex . the mean size of this region diverges at the critical point . we find an exact mapping of the kcore percolation to a model of cooperative relaxation . this model undergoes critical relaxation with a divergent rate at some critical moment .

doc: blind arbitrary private computations from group homomorphic encryption secure function evaluation is the process of computing a function or running an algorithm on some data , while keeping the input , output and intermediate results hidden from the environment in which the function is evaluated . this can be done using fully homomorphic encryption , circuits or secure multiparty computation . applications are manifold , most prominently the outsourcing of computations to cloud service providers , where data is to be manipulated and processed in full confidentiality . today , one of the most intensively studied solutions to is fully homomorphic encryption . ever since the first such systems have been discovered in 2009 , and despite much progress , still remains inefficient and difficult to implement practically . similar concerns apply to circuits and generic multiparty computation protocols . in this work , we introduce the concept of a blind , which uses simple homomorphic encryption an extension of encryption to process in the way as standard do , thus achieving computability of any function in total privacy . remarkably , this shows that fully homomorphic encryption is indeed an overly strong primitive to do , as group homomorphic encryption with equality check is already sufficient . moreover , the technique is easy to implement and perhaps opens the door to efficient private computations on nowadays computing machinery , requiring only simple changes to wellestablished computer architectures .

doc: predicting the probability of change in objectoriented systems of all merits of the objectoriented paradigm , flexibility is probably the most important in a world of constantly changing requirements and the most striking difference compared to previous approaches . however , it is rather difficult to quantify this aspect of quality this paper describes a probabilistic approach to estimate the change of an objectoriented design by evaluating the probability that each class of the system will be affected when new functionality is added or when existing functionality is modified . it is obvious that when a system exhibits a large sensitivity to changes , the corresponding design quality is questionable . the extracted probabilities of change can be used to assist maintenance and to observe the evolution of stability through successive generations and identify a possible level beyond which any attempt to improve the design without major refactoring is impossible . the proposed model has been evaluated on two open source projects . the process has been fully automated by a java program , while statistical analysis has proved improved correlation between the extracted probabilities and actual changes in each of the classes in comparison to a prediction model that relies simply on past data .

doc: hey basic helixloophelix transcription factors are repressors of and and restrict expression of the gata target gene anf in fetal hearts the hey basic helixloophelix transcription factors are downstream effectors of notch signaling in the cardiovascular system . mice lacking hey2 develop cardiac hypertrophy , often associated with congenital heart defects , whereas combined deficiency leads to severe vascular defects and embryonic lethality around embryonic day . 5 . the molecular basis of these disorders is poorly understood , however , since target genes of hey transcription factors in the affected tissues remain elusive . to identify genes regulated by hey factors we have generated a conditional hey1 knockout mouse . this strain was used to generate paired hey2 and embryonic stem cell lines . comparison of these cell lines by microarray analysis identified and as differentially expressed genes . loss of leads to elevated and anf mrna levels in bodies , while forced expression of hey factors strongly expression of the and promoter in various cell lines . in addition , the promoter activity of the target gene anf was inhibited by hey1 , hey2 , and heyl . protein interaction and mutation analyses suggest that repression is due to direct binding of hey proteins to and , blocking their transcriptional activity . in fetal hearts we observed elevated mrna levels of anf and . expression of anf and hey2 is normally restricted to the and compact myocardial layer , respectively . , loss of hey2 leads to ectopic anf expression in the compact layer , suggesting a direct role for hey2 in limiting anf expression in this cardiac compartment .

doc: ranking of wikipedia articles in search engines revisited fair ranking for reasonable quality this paper aims to review the discussed question of whether the ranking of wikipedia articles in search engines is justified by the quality of the articles . after an overview of current research on information quality in wikipedia , a summary of the extended discussion on the quality of encyclopedic entries in general is given . on this basis , a heuristic method for evaluating wikipedia entries is developed and applied to wikipedia articles that scored highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the relevance judgment of . in all search engines tested , wikipedia results are judged better by the than other results on the corresponding results position . relevance judgments often roughly correspond with the results from the heuristic evaluation . cases in which high relevance judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low score from the heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an indicator of a high degree of trust in wikipedia . one of the systemic shortcomings of wikipedia lies in its necessarily user model . a further tuning of the suggested criteria catalog , for instance , the different weighing of the supplied criteria , could serve as a starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation of wikipedia articles . approved methods of quality evaluation of reference works are applied to wikipedia articles and integrated with the question of search engine evaluation . copy 2011 wiley periodicals , inc .

doc: the join one of the most common operations in analytic query processing is the application of an aggregate function to the result of a relational join . we describe an algorithm called the sms join for computing the answer to such a query over large , diskbased input tables . the key innovation of the sms join is that if the input data are clustered in a statistically random fashion on disk , then at all times , the join provides an online , statistical estimator for the eventual answer to the query as well as probabilistic confidence bounds . thus , a user can monitor the progress of the join throughout its execution and stop the join when satisfied with the estimates accuracy or run the algorithm to completion with a total time requirement that is not much longer than that of other common join algorithms . this contrasts with other online join algorithms , which either do not offer such statistical guarantees or can only offer guarantees so long as the input data can fit into main memory .

doc: integration of statistical and rulebased dialog managers statistical dialog managers can potentially make more robust decisions than their rulebased counterparts , because they can account for uncertainties due to errors in speech recognition and natural language understanding . in practice , however , statistical dialog managers can be difficult to use , as they may require a large number of parameters to be inferred from limited data . consequently , handcrafted rule based systems are still effective for practical use . this paper proposes a method to integrate an existing rulebased dialog manager with a statistical dialog manager based on bayes decision theory , by incorporating the rulebased dialog manager into the cost function of the statistical dialog manager . the cost function has two parts an efficiency cost that inefficient actions , as in conventional statistical dialog approaches , and a regularization cost that slightly system actions that differ from those that would be chosen by the rulebased system . our experiments , which use a task in an automobile dialog scenario , demonstrate that the integrated system produces system actions that are similar to those of an existing rulebased dialog manager but enable task completion using fewer turns than the rulebased system .

doc: the semantic web revisited the original scientific american article on the semantic web appeared in 2001 . it described the evolution of a web that consisted largely of documents for humans to read to one that included data and information for computers to manipulate . the semantic web is a web of actionable informationinformation derived from data through a semantic theory for interpreting the symbols . this simple idea , however , remains largely unrealized . shopbots and auction bots abound on the web , but these are essentially handcrafted for particular tasks they have little ability to interact with heterogeneous data and information types . because we havent yet delivered largescale , agentbased mediation , some commentators argue that the semantic web has failed to deliver . we argue that agents can only flourish when standards are well established and that the web standards for expressing shared meaning have progressed steadily over the past five years . furthermore , we see the use of ontologies in the escience community presaging ultimate success for the semantic webjust as the use of http within the cern particle physics community led to the revolutionary success of the original web .

doc: cytoplasmic camp concentrations in intact cardiac myocytes in cardiac myocytes there is evidence that activation of some receptors can regulate protein kinase a responses by stimulating camp production that is limited to discrete intracellular domains . we previously developed a computational model of camp signaling to investigate the feasibility of this idea . the model was able to reproduce experimental results demonstrating that both beta1adrenergic and m2 muscarinic camp changes occur in associated with pka signaling . however , the model also suggested that the camp concentration throughout most of the cell could be significantly higher than that found in domains . in the present study we tested this hypothesis using a freely fluorescence resonance energy constructed from the type 2 exchange protein activated by camp . it was determined that in adult ventricular myocytes the basal camp concentration detected by the probe is approximately 1 . 2 mum , which is high enough to maximally activate pka . furthermore , the probe detected responses produced by both and m2 receptor activation . modeling suggests that responses detected by mainly reflect what is happening in a bulk cytosolic compartment with little contribution from where pka signaling occurs . these results support the conclusion that even though and m2 receptor activation can produce global changes in camp , plays an important role by maintaining where camp levels are significantly below that found throughout most of the cell . this allows receptor stimulation to regulate camp activity over concentration ranges appropriate for modulating both higher e . g . , pka and lower affinity e . g . , effectors .

doc: bootstrapping knowledge about social phenomena using simulation models there are considerable difficulties in the way of the development of useful and reliable simulation models of social phenomena , including that any simulation necessarily includes many assumptions that are not directly supported by evidence . despite these difficulties , many still hope to develop quite general models of social phenomena . this paper argues that such hopes are , in other words that there will be no to useful and reliable simulation models . however this paper argues that there is a way forward , that simulation modelling can be used to bootstrap useful knowledge about social phenomena . if each bit of simulation work can result in the rejection of some of the possible processes in observed social phenomena , even if this is about a very specific social context , then this can be used as part of a process of gradually refining our knowledge about such processes in the form of simulation models . such a bootstrapping process will only be possible if simulation models are more carefully judged , that is a greater selective pressure is applied . in particular models which are just an analogy of social processes in computational form should be treated as personal rather than scientific knowledge . such models are useful for informing the intuition of its developers and users , but do not help the community of social simulators and social scientists to bootstrap reliable social knowledge . however , it is argued that both participatory modelling and evidencebased modelling can play a useful part in this process . some kinds of simulation model are discussed with respect to their suitability for the bootstrapping of social knowledge . the knowledge that results is likely to be of a

doc: linking modeldriven development and software architecture a case study a basic premise of model driven development mdd is to capture all important design information in a set of formal or semiformal models which are then automatically kept consistent by tools . the concept however is still relatively immature and there is little by way of empirically validated guidelines . in this paper we report on the use of mdd on a significant realworld project over several years . our research found the mdd approach to be deficient in terms of modelling architectural design rules . furthermore , the current body of literature does not offer a satisfactory solution as to how architectural design rules should be modelled . as a result developers have to rely on timeconsuming and errorprone manual practices to keep a system consistent with its architecture . to realise the full benefits of mdd it is important to find ways of formalizing architectural design rules which then allow automatic enforcement of the architecture on the system model . without this , architectural enforcement will remain a bottleneck in large mdd projects .

doc: pattern recognitionbased environment identification for robust wireless devices positioning there has been a continuous increase in the demands for global navigation satellite system receivers in a wide range of applications . more and more wireless and mobile devices are equipped with builtin receivers their users mobility behavior can result in challenging signal conditions that have detrimental effects on the receivers tracking and positioning accuracy . a major error source is the multipath signals , which are signals that are reflected off different surfaces and to the antenna via different paths . analysis of the received multipath signals indicated that their characteristics depend on the surrounding environment . this paper introduces a machinelearning pattern recognition algorithm that utilizes the aforementioned dependency to classify the multipath signals characteristics and identify the surrounding environment . the identified environment is utilized in a novel adaptive tracking technique that enables a receiver to change its tracking strategy to best suit the current signal condition . this will lead to a robust positioning under challenging signal conditions . the algorithm is verified using real and simulated global positioning system gps signals with accurate multipath models .

doc: health education and community empowerment conceptualizing and measuring perceptions of individual , organizational , and community control the prevailing emphasis in health education is on understanding and changing lifestyle choices and individual health behaviors related to health status . although such approaches are appropriate for some health problems , they often ignore the association between increased morbidity and mortality and social , structural , and physical factors in the environment , such as inadequate housing , poor , unemployment , exposure to toxic , occupational stress , minority status , powerlessness or , and the lack of supportive interpersonal relationships . a conceptual model of the stress process incorporates the relationships among these environmental factors , powerlessness or conversely empowerment , social support , and health status . the concept of empowerment has been examined in diverse academic disciplines and professional fields . however , there is still a lack of clarity on the conceptualization of empowerment at different levels of practice , including its measurement , relationship to health , and application to health education . the purpose of this article is to address these issues as they relate to the concept of community empowerment . it provides a definition of community empowerment that includes individual , organizational , and community levels of analysis describes how empowerment fits within a broader conceptual model of stress and its relationship to health status and examines a series of scales that measure perceptions of individual , organizational , community , and multiple levels of control . the article concludes with broad guidelines for and barriers to a community empowerment approach for health education practice .

doc: knowledge transfer for cross domain learning to rank recently , learning to rank technology is attracting increasing attention from both academia and industry in the areas of machine learning and information retrieval . a number of algorithms have been proposed to rank documents according to the query using a training dataset . a basic assumption behind general learning to rank algorithms is that the training and test data are drawn from the same data distribution . however , this assumption does not always hold true in real world applications . for example , it can be violated when the labeled training data become outdated or originally come from another domain different from its counterpart of test data . such situations bring a new problem , which we define as cross domain learning to rank . in this paper , we aim at improving the learning of a ranking model in target domain by leveraging knowledge from the outdated or data both are referred to as source domain data . we first give a formal definition of the cross domain learning to rank problem . following this , two novel methods are proposed to conduct knowledge transfer at feature level and instance level , respectively . these two methods both utilize ranking svm as the basic learner . in the experiments , we evaluate these two methods using data from benchmark datasets for document retrieval . the results show that the transfer method performs better with steady improvements over baseline approaches across different datasets , while the instancelevel transfer method comes out with varying performance depending on the dataset used .

doc: activation of a high affinity gi proteincoupled plasma membrane receptor by spp has attracted much attention as a possible second messenger controlling cell proliferation and motility and as an intracellular agent . here , we present evidence that spp activates a g proteincoupled receptor in the plasma membrane of various cells , leading to increase in cytoplasmic ca2 concentration ca2i , inhibition of adenylyl cyclase , and opening of g potassium channels . in human kidney hek cells , spp ec50 , 2 nm and rapidly increased ca2i in a pertussis manner . pertussis increase in ca2i was also observed with ec50 , nm , whereas other , including , , , and at concentrations did not or only marginally increased ca2i . furthermore , spp inhibited camp accumulation in hek cells and increased binding of to hek cell membranes . rapid ca2i responses were also observed in human transitional bladder carcinoma cells , cells , mouse nih cells , chinese cells , and rat cells , whereas human leukemia cells and human cells failed to respond to spp . in atrial myocytes , spp activated gi inwardly rectifying potassium channels . activation of these channels occurred strictly when spp was applied at the extracellular face of atrial myocyte plasma membrane as measured in and patch clamp current recordings . we conclude that spp , in addition to its proposed direct action on intracellular ca2 stores , interacts with a high affinity gi proteincoupled receptor in the plasma membrane of apparently many different cell types .

doc: understanding user goals in web search previous work on understanding user web search behavior has focused on how people search and what they are searching for , but not why they are searching . in this paper , we describe a framework for understanding the underlying goals of user searches , and our experience in using the framework to manually classify queries from a web search engine . our analysis suggests that socalled navigational searches are less prevalent than generally believed while a previously unexplored goal may account for a large fraction of web searches . we also illustrate how this knowledge of user search goals might be used to improve future web search engines .

doc: a fuel index for grassland assessment the assessment of fuel moisture content on a large spatial scale requires several observations and estimates and is often time consuming and costly due to labour and transportation . therefore , various models based on empirical functions of weather variables have been developed and applied to determine the amount of moisture in fuel . in this paper , a fuel index fd based on biophysical principles associated with energy exchange is presented and applied to monitor fuel moisture content for annual . daily values of fd were determined as the ratio of sensible heat flux density to the available energy using highfrequency temperature data and the surface renewal sr method in combination with net radiation and soil heat flux values . the sr method was evaluated by comparing with sensible and latent heat flux densities from eddy covariance data measured in a annual grassland . the fd values and trends were compared with three wellknown slow response indices including the index , two modified versions of the factor in the forest meter , and the fast response fine fuel moisture code of the canadian fire weather index . moreover , fd index was compared with the grassland meter . the fd index was more responsive to daily changes than most of the other indices , providing accurate information on fuel condition of a live vegetation grassland . in addition , it can potentially eliminate the need for calibrated empirical weather models and fuel stick measurements .

doc: how to search a social network we address the question of how participants in a small world experiment are able to find short paths in a social network using only local information about their immediate contacts . we simulate such experiments on a network of actual email contacts within an organization as well as on a student social networking website . on the email network we find that small world search strategies using a contacts position in physical space or in an organizational hierarchy relative to the target can effectively be used to locate most individuals . however , we find that in the online student network , where the data is incomplete and hierarchical structures are not well defined , local search strategies are less effective . we compare our findings to recent theoretical hypotheses about underlying social structure that would enable these simple search strategies to succeed and discuss the implications to social software design .

doc: simulations of magnetized multiphase galactic disk regulated by supernovae explosions what exactly controls star formation in the galaxy remains controversial . in particular , the role of feedback and magnetic field are still partially understood . we investigate the role played by supernovae feedback and magnetic field onto the star formation and the structure of the galactic disk . we perform numerical simulations of the turbulent , magnetized , , multiphase , supernovae regulated ism within a 1 kpc stratified box . we implemented various schemes for the supernovae . this goes from a random distribution at a fixed rate to distributions for which the supernovae are spatially and temporally correlated to the formation of stars . to study the influence of magnetic field on star formation , we perform both hydrodynamical and simulations . we find that supernovae feedback has a influence on the galactic evolution . the supernovae distribution is playing a very significant role . when the supernovae are not correlated with star formation events , they do not modify significantly the very high star formation rate obtained without feedback . when the supernovae follow the accretion , the star formation rate can be reduced by a factor up to 30 . magnetic field is also playing a significant role . it reduces the star formation rate by a factor up to 23 and reduces the number of collapse sites by a factor of about 2 . the exact correlation between the supernovae and the dense gas appears to have significant consequences on the galactic disk evolution and the star formation . this implies that small scale studies are necessary to understand and quantify the feedback efficiency . magnetic field does influence the star formation at galactic scales by reducing the star formation rate

doc: towards a taxonomy of software change previous taxonomies of software change have focused on the purpose of the change i . e . , the why rather than the underlying mechanisms . this paper proposes a taxonomy of software change based on characterizing the mechanisms of change and the factors that influence these mechanisms . the ultimate goal of this taxonomy is to provide a framework that positions concrete tools , formalisms and methods within the domain of software evolution . such a framework would considerably ease comparison between the various mechanisms of change . it would also allow practitioners to identify and evaluate the relevant tools , methods and formalisms for a particular change scenario . as an initial step towards this taxonomy , the paper presents a framework that can be used to characterize software change support tools and to identify the factors that impact on the use of these tools . the framework is evaluated by applying it to three different change support tools and by comparing these tools based on this analysis .
