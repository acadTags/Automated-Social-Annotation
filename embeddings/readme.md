The embedding of vocabularies and embedding of labels for each dataset are stored here before running the program. Files under this folder can be downloaded from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlvsB_ZEXPkijP1_mufUWbz8rCVoEA) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bu7hD8-nvB_pOzrMfCebFw)```password:f5fe```.

The embeddings were created with the [danielfrg's word2vec python package](https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec).
