The embedding of vocabularies and embedding of labels for each dataset are stored here before running the program. Files under this folder can be downloaded from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AlvsB_ZEXPkijqsFvM0iDt-AYi6iEg) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-geSqJvwfWh5NZYXsWZEcA)```password:w9iu```.

The embeddings were created with the [danielfrg's word2vec python package](https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec).
